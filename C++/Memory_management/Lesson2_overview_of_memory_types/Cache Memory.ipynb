    "Depending on the machine used for executing the two code versions, there will be a huge difference in execution time. In order to understand why this happens, let us revisit the memory layout we investigated with the gdb debugger at the beginning of this lesson: Even though we have created a two-dimensional array, it is stored in a one-dimensional succession of memory cells. In our minds, the array will (probably) look like this: \n",

    "As can be see, the difference between two rows is now 0x10, which is 16 in the decimal system. This means that with each access to the matrix, four memory cells are skipped and the principle of spatial locality is violated. As a result, the wrong data is loaded into the L1 cache, leading to cache misses and costly reload operations - hence the significantly increased execution time between the two code samples. The difference in execution time of both code samples shows that cache-aware programming can increase code performance significantly."
