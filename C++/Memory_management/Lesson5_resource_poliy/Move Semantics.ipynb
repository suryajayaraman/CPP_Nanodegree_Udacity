    "There is one more important aspect we need to consider: *rvalue references are themselves lvalues.*  While this might seem confusing at first glance, it really is the mechanism that enables move semantics: A reference is always defined in a certain context (such as in the above example the variable `val`) .  Even though the object it refers to (the number `42`) may be disposable in the context it has been created (the `main` function),  it is not disposable in the context of the reference . So within the scope of  `myFunction`, `val` is an lvalue as it gives access to the memory location where the number 42 is stored. \n",

There is a solution to this problem though: The function `std::move`  converts an lvalue into an rvalue (actually, to be exact, into an *xvalue*, which we will not discuss here for the sake of clarity), which makes it possible to use the lvalue as an argument for the function: \n",

This rule is an extension of the Rule of Three which we have already seen and exists since the introduction of the C++11 standard. The Rule of Five is especially important in resource management, where unnecessary copying needs to be avoided due to limited resources and performance reasons. Also, all the STL container classes such as `std::vector` implement the Rule of Five and use move semantics for increased efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Rule of Five states that if you have to write one of the functions listed below then you should consider implementing all of them with a proper resource management policy in place. If you forget to implement one or more, the compiler will usually generate the missing ones (without a warning) but the default versions might not be suitable for the purpose you have in mind. The five functions are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **destructor**: Responsible for freeing the resource once the object it belongs to goes out of scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **assignment operator**: The default assignment operation performs a member-wise shallow copy, which does not copy the content behind the resource handle. If a deep copy is needed, it has be implemented by the programmer. \n",

    "3. The **copy constructor**: As with the assignment operator, the default copy constructor performs a shallow copy of the data members. If something else is needed, the programmer has to implement it accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The **move constructor**: Because copying objects can be an expensive operation which involves creating, copying and destroying temporary objects, rvalue references are used to bind to an rvalue. Using this mechanism, the move constructor transfers the ownership of a resource from a (temporary) rvalue object to a permanent lvalue object. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The **move assignment operator**: With this operator, ownership of a resource can be transferred from one object to another. The internal behavior is very similar to the move constructor."

    "\n",
    "One of the primary areas of application are cases, where heavy-weight objects need to be passed around in a program. Copying these without move semantics can cause series performance issues. The idea in this scenario is to create the object a single time and then \"simply\" move it around using rvalue references and move semantics. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second area of application are cases where ownership needs to be transferred (such as with unique pointers, as we will soon see). The primary difference to shared references is that with move semantics we are not sharing anything but instead we are ensuring through a smart policy that only a single object at a time has access to and thus owns the resource."

As expected from an rvalue, its destructor is called immediately afterwards. But as we have made sure to null its data pointer in the move constructor, the actual data will not be deleted. The advantage from a performance perspective in this case is that no deep-copy of the rvalue object needs to be made, we are simply redirecting the internal resource handle thus making an efficient shallow copy. \n",

    "There is one final aspect we need to look at: In some cases, it can make sense to treat lvalues like rvalues. At some point in your code, you might want to transfer ownership of a resource to another part of your program as it is not needed anymore in the current scope. But instead of copying it, you want to just move it as we have seen before. The \"problem\" with our implementation of MyMovableClass is that the call `useObject(obj1)` will trigger the copy constructor as we have seen in one of the last examples. But in order to move it, we would have to pretend to the compiler that `obj1` was an rvalue instead of an lvalue so that we can make an efficient move operation instead of an expensive copy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a solution to this problem in C++, which is `std::move`.  This function accepts an lvalue argument and returns it as an rvalue without triggering copy construction. So by passing an object to `std::move` we can force the compiler to use move semantics, either in the form of move constructor or the move assignment operator:\n",

Note that after the call to `useObject`, the instance `obj1` has been invalidated by setting its internal handle to null and thus may not be used anymore within the scope of `main` (even though you could theoretically try to access it, but this would be a really bad idea).
