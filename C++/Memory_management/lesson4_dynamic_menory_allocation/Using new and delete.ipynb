    "## Comparing `malloc` with `new`\n",
    "The functions `malloc` and `free` are library function and represent the default way of allocating and deallocating memory in C. In C++, they are also part of the standard and can be used to allocate blocks of memory on the heap. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of classes and object oriented programming in C++ however, memory allocation and deallocation has become more complex: When an object is created, its constructor needs to be called to allow for member initialization. Also, on object deletion, the destructor is called to free resources and to allow for programmer-defined clean-up tasks. For this reason, C++ introduces the operators `new` / `delete`, which represent the object-oriented counterpart to memory management with `malloc` / `free`."

    "If we were to create a C++ object with `malloc`, the constructor and destructor of such an object would not be called. Consider the class on the right. The constructor allocates memory for the private element `_number` (yes, we could have simply used `int` instead of `int*`, but that's for educational purposes only), and the destructor releases memory again. The setter method `setNumber` finally assigns a value to `_number` under the assumption that memory has been allocated previously. \n",

    "In main, we will allocate memory for an instance of MyClass using both `malloc`/ `free` and `new`/`delete`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Constructors / Destructors**\n",
    "Unlike `malloc( sizeof(MyClass) )`, the call `new MyClass()` calls the constructor. Similarly, `delete` calls the destructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type safety**\n",
    "`malloc` returns a void pointer, which needs to be cast into the appropriate data type it points to. This is not type safe, as you can freely vary the pointer type without any warnings or errors from the compiler as in the following small example:\n",
    " `MyObject *p = (MyObject*)malloc(sizeof(int));`\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, the call `MyObject *p = new MyObject()` returns the correct type automatically - it is thus type-safe. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operator Overloading**\n",
    "As `malloc` and `free` are functions defined in a library, their behavior can not be changed easily. The new and delete operators however can be overloaded by a class in order to include optional proprietary behavior. We will look at an example of overloading `new` further down in this section."

If the programmer forgets to call `delete` on the object (which happens quite often, even with experienced programmers), the object resides in memory until the program terminates at some point in the future causing a *memory leak*.\n",

    "## Optimizing Performance with `placement new`\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it makes sense to separate memory allocation from object construction. Consider a case where we need to reconstruct an object several times. If we were to use the standard `new`/`delete` construct, memory would be allocated and freed unnecessarily as only the content of the memory block changes but not its size. By separating allocation from construction, we can get a significant performance increase. \n",
    "\n",
    "C++ allows us to do this by using a construct called *placement new*: With `placement new`, we can pass a preallocated memory and construct an object at that memory location. Consider the following code: \n",

    "MyClass *object = new (memory) MyClass;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax `new (memory)` is denoted as *placement new*. The difference to the \"conventional\" `new` we have been using so far is that that no memory is allocated. The call constructs an object and places it in the assigned memory location. There is however, no `delete` equivalent to `placement new`, so we have to call the destructor explicitly in this case instead of using `delete` as we would have done with a regular call to `new`: \n",

    "object->~MyClass();\n",
