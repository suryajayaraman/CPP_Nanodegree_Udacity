    "\n",
    "To reserve memory on the heap, one of the two functions `malloc` (stands for *Memory Allocation*) or `calloc` (stands for *Cleared Memory Allocation*) is used. The header file `stdlib.h` or `malloc.h` must be included to use the functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the syntax of `malloc` and `calloc` in C/C++:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pointer_name = (cast-type*) malloc(size);\n",
    "pointer_name = (cast-type*) calloc(num_elems, size_elem);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`malloc` is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size. It returns a pointer of type `void` which can be cast into a pointer of any form.\n",

For an int, this would be 4 bytes but for a double, the offset would be 8 bytes. So in order to retrieve the entire block of memory that has been reserved, we need to know the data type and the way to achieve this with `malloc` is by casting the return pointer: \n",

So `realloc` will not erase memory but merely mark it as \"available\" for future allocations. It should be noted however that accessing a memory location _after_ such an operation must be avoided as it could cause a segmentation fault. We will encounter segmentation faults soon when we discuss \"dangling pointers\" in one of the next lessons. "
